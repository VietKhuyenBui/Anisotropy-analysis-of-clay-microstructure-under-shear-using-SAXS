Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) enables non-destructive analysis of anisotropy in suspensions and colloids and provides information on the ordering and structure of the internal particle arrangement. Such information is particularly relevant for clay materials, whose mechanical response strongly depends on microstructure. Here, we introduce a method for analysing SAXS images that focuses on extracting orientation measures (Q-tensor) and preferred angles via ellipse-based fitting. The workflow is applied to clay slurries sheared in a Couette cell under various shear rates and a similar relative liquidity for three clay minerals: kaolinite, halloysite, and Na-montmorillonite. Kaolinite exhibits higher anisotropy than halloysite and Na-montmorillonite and reaches its maximum anisotropy at a lower shear rate. Beyond clay science, the methodology is relevant to broader materials science and nanotechnology for studying the orientation of other particles and internal fabrics.
